## Professional Background

Hey everyone! I'm Mateusz, hailing from the beautiful country, Poland. My professional journey revolves around the fascinating world of embedded systems and low-level programming. I specialize in **FPGA programming**, diving deep into **kernel development**, and crafting robust systems with **Yocto** and **Buildroot**. On top of that, I'm proficient in **Bash scripting** and enjoy leveraging **Docker** for efficient development workflows, all while using **Python** for various tasks. I also have extensive experience in the field of cybersecurity.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me out on the water, paddling my kayak (you can check out my adventures on my [<<< YouTube channel >>>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ4LH0jrgK2l0PJ-q9K6hTA/videos)). I'm also passionate about biblical studies and theology, always exploring new books. I channel my creativity into music production and writing poetry. Plus, I have a keen interest in ornithology â€“ there's so much to learn about birds!
